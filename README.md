# Ghost Rigger

Prototype of a cyberpunk-inspired puzzle game set in a distopian future:

> In the year 2078, the megacorporation *Native Development Initiative*, aka NDI, rules the Earth.
>
> While they look for new evil ways to increase their margins and satisfy their never-ending greed, a group of hackers are trying to stop them. They call themselves *Unanymous*.
>
> Within them, those who focus their efforts on fighting against NDI's injustices are known as *ghost riggers*.

In this game, the player will become a ghost rigger, and they will have to solve puzzles to progress and reveal the story.
